## PATH RAYTRACER

This code is based on the book Ray Tracing in one weekend with some slight
adjustments on the piping method that is used to produce the image.

Instead, it creates a .ppm file using a basic file stream. 

You can view it using a ppm viewer extension on VS code or any free ppm viewer
on your browser. 

This was a fun project that unfortunately did not take a weekend but could have
if not for some weird shenanigans I made while trying to debug instead of actually
understanding the code. 
But be it known this shall not be my last attempt to path raytracing... hopefully.
Anyways, here is a picture of the rendered code for now:
